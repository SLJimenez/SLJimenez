Professional Statement:
I am currently in the Army as a Human Resources Sergeant. Before I joined the Army in 2019, I was in the health care industry working full time as a medical coding and billing specialist for Change Healthcare a third-party medical coding and billing company.  During my time working for the Change Healthcare, I was trained in PII, SPII and HIPPA guidelines due to managing patient information on a day-to-day basis. While in this role I learned to develop my strength in multi-tasking, time management, customer service and consistency.  When I transitioned to the Armed Forces my job requires me to manage Soldiers personal information, records, and accountability.  In these very distinct roles in two different worlds, I play an important role managing and securing information. While I was in the Army, I developed resiliency and a greater sense of what my core values are. I believe that these roles have led me to strive to be in the Cyber security realm for the reason that I want to have a more in a security role. Not only do I want to manage information, but I want to secure information, create new and innovative security programs in which peopleâ€™s information will be protected and find people that are using their skills in the Cyber world to take advantage of other people.
